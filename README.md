# MSDS-634 : Deep Learning for AI
Deep learning is a sub-field of machine learning that focuses on learning complex, hierarchical feature representations from raw data. Over the past decade, deep learning has been remarkably successful at solving a massive set of problems on data types including images and sequential data. This success drove the extension of deep learning to other discrete domains such as sets, point clouds , graphs, and 3D shapes.

This course introduces the student to a range of topics and concepts in deep learning including the foundation neural networks, most common neural network architectures such as MLP, convolutional neural networks, transformers and recurrent neural networks to name a few. We we also go over a few advanced topics such as probabilistic/topological/geometric deep learning and graph neural networks. The course covers a practical aspects of deep learning and students get to learn how to use pytroch for creation/training/inference of various networks. Intuition, mathematical notions as well as the practical aspects are all emphasized throughout the course and by the end of the course the student should have a solid theoretical and practical foundation of deep learning.

# Final Project (Total 50%)

## Task 1: The Project Proposal, Data Selection, and Data Description (Total 5%) (Due)

The Project Proposal, Data Selection, and Description component hold a weightage of 5% in determining your final course grade. This stage of the project requires you to submit a well-structured project proposal that encompasses several key elements:

### Project Proposal:

You need to outline the objectives and goals of your project clearly. Explain the problem you intend to address using deep learning techniques and describe the overall approach you plan to take.

### Data Selection: 
Selecting appropriate data is crucial for the success of your project. You should detail the sources from which you will obtain your data and explain why these sources are suitable for your project. Additionally, discuss any preprocessing steps that may be required.

### Data Description: 
Provide a comprehensive description of the data you will be working with. This includes information about the data format, size, attributes, and any inherent challenges or limitations associated with the data. Clearly state how the selected data aligns with your project objectives.

## Task 2: Jupyter notebook and Medium Post (Total 35%) (Due)

This project requires you to create a comprehensive and well-structured Jupyter notebook that effectively presents your work. The notebook should include the following components:

### Data Preprocessing (5%)
Describe the methods and steps employed to preprocess and prepare the data for your deep learning model. This may involve tasks such as data cleaning, feature engineering, data augmentation, or any other relevant preprocessing techniques.

### Model Implementation (10%)
Detail the architecture and implementation details of your deep learning model. Include code snippets, well-commented code cells, or references to external code repositories if applicable. Explain the rationale behind your model choices and any modifications or enhancements you made to existing models.

### Methods (5%)
Provide a clear description of the methodologies used in your project. Explain the algorithms, techniques, or frameworks employed, ensuring that your approach is well-documented and reproducible.

### Experiments and Results (10%)
Present the experiments conducted during your project and report the obtained results. Include relevant performance metrics, accuracy scores, loss curves, or any other measurements used to evaluate your model's performance. Use tables, graphs, or visualizations to effectively communicate your experimental findings.

### Medium Post (10%)
Write a Medium post about your project, covering the same topics as the project proposal but in a more narrative and engaging format. The Medium post should be structured to attract readers and provide them with a clear understanding of your project's objectives, data selection process, and the significance of your work.

Please ensure that your Jupyter notebook is well-documented and organized, making it easy for others to understand and reproduce your work. The total grade for the project is out of 30% of your final course grade.

## Task 3: Recorded presentation (10%) (Due)

The recorded presentation contributes 10% to your overall course grade. You will be required to deliver a presentation, recorded in video format, where you showcase and explain your project, including its objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions. This should not exceed 10 minutes and should be presented by all team members.​
